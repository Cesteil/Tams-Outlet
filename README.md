# Tam's Single Item Outlet

Welcome to the Tam Team! Here at Tam's Super Legit Business Co. LLC we offer the best item one can purchase -- just don't look directly in it's eyes.

However, we currently don't have a good CSS developer on the team. This is why we hired you! Use the mock-ups provided to guide you through laying out the web pages the way we want. From there, you are free to style things however you'd like. Right now we just have a general idea where everything should be on the page. It doesn't have to be "pixel perfect", just follow the mockups as best you can.

However, our HTML team passed along the following requirements:

You are allowed to:
* Update the content, such as image sources or text inside elements
* Add classes or Ids to elements

You are **NOT** allowed to:
* Change the structure in any way, such as adding or moving elements

Some tips for getting started:

* Review what you have in the pages -- as you look through things add classes to help you under
* Avoid adding classes to semantic elements, like nav -- let the tag name guide you with those
* When in doubt, refer to the mockup or ask Tam's representative in class (your instructors)
* Make sure you work on a branch then merge into main when you are finished
